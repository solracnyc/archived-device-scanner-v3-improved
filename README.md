# Archived Device Scanner v3.2.0 (Improved)

The best version of the Google Workspace Archived Device Scanner - a hybrid combining the robust features from v2 original with the improved UI/UX from the Gemini version.

## Why This Version?

This v3.0.0 "Improved" version is the recommended version because it:
- ‚úÖ Combines the best features from both previous versions
- ‚úÖ Has the most efficient code (smallest file size, fewest lines)
- ‚úÖ Includes robust retry logic with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Features an improved UI with setup wizard
- ‚úÖ Maintains all critical functionality in a cleaner implementation

## Quick Start

1. **Create a new Google Apps Script project**
2. **Copy the code** from `MinimalArchivedDeviceScanner.gs`
3. **Add the Admin SDK API service**:
   - Click Services ‚Üí Find "Admin SDK API" ‚Üí Add
   - Ensure identifier is `AdminDirectory`
4. **Run the setup**:
   - Run ‚Üí Select `onOpen` ‚Üí Review permissions
   - Device Scanner ‚Üí Setup Sheets
5. **Start scanning**:
   - Device Scanner ‚Üí Start Scan

## Features

- üöÄ **Optimized Performance**: Processes accounts in batches of 100
- üîÑ **Smart Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- üìä **Real-time Progress**: Live updates in status sheet
- üéØ **Flexible Testing**: Test individual accounts before full scan
- üìù **Debug Logging**: Optional debug sheet for troubleshooting
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Resumable**: Pause and resume scans anytime
- üîç **Device Preview**: Check what devices accounts have before deletion
- ‚è±Ô∏è **No Timeouts**: Both scan and preview handle large datasets with automatic pause/resume

## Performance Characteristics

- **Current Speed**: ~5,000 accounts takes several hours with multiple 4.5-minute execution cycles
- **Processing Method**: Sequential account processing (one API call per email address)
- **Optimization Status**: Research phase - investigating batch queries and parallel processing
- **Scalability**: Handles any number of accounts through automatic pause/resume mechanism

## Menu Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Setup Sheets | Creates required sheets with headers |
| Start Scan | Begins scanning all archived accounts and removes devices (auto-resumes if timeout) |
| Test Single Account | Tests one account before full scan |
| Scan Device Preview | Shows device count and models without deleting (auto-resumes if timeout) |
| Check Status | Shows current scan progress for both removal and preview operations |
| Reset Scan | Clears all data and state for both scans |

## Sheet Structure

### Archived Accounts Sheet
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Email Address | User's email address |
| Device Count | Number of devices found (populated by preview) |
| Device Models | List of device models (populated by preview) |
| Last Scanned | Timestamp of last preview scan |

### Device Log Sheet
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | When the action occurred |
| Email | User's email address |
| Status | REMOVED/FAILED/NOT_FOUND/ERROR |
| Device Model | Device model name |
| Device Type | Type of device |
| Device ID | Unique device identifier |
| Notes | Additional information or error messages |

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation
- **Processing**: Sequential account scanning (one API call per email)
- **API Method**: `AdminDirectory.Mobiledevices.list()` with email-specific queries
- **Batch Size**: 100 devices per API call (for pagination within each user)
- **Execution Limits**: 4.5-minute cycles with automatic pause/resume
- **State Management**: Persistent state saved every 10 accounts

### Known Limitations
- Sequential processing limits throughput for large datasets
- Individual API calls required for each email address
- Fixed 60-second continuation delays between execution cycles
- Full device projection retrieved even for preview-only operations

### Future Optimization Opportunities
See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for detailed optimization research and potential improvements.

## Requirements

- Google Workspace Admin access
- Admin SDK API enabled
- Appropriate permissions to view users and devices
